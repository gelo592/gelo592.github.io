          <h2>QuitSmart Program</h2>
          <h4>QuitSmart Smoking Cessation Program Overview</h4>
          <p>The QuitSmart program was developed using over 30 years of research and practice by Duke University Addictions Program.</p>
          <p>Results of the QuitSmart treatment are encouraging; with 6 to 12 month quit rates in non-psychiatric patients of 48&ndash;66% ? much higher than the 20&ndash;30% 6 to 12 month abstinent rates found for most stop-smoking programs.</p>
          <p>Why support a smoking Cessation program?</p>
          <p>YOU CANNOT AFFORD NOT TOO!</p>
          <p>There are many compelling medical reasons to give up smoking, foremost among them an increased risk of developing a number of deadly diseases.</p>
          <p>In fact, one of every two long-term smokers will die early from a disease caused by smoking. Many smokers have tried to quit but find it hard to avoid the pitfalls that lie along the path of abstinence.</p>
          <h4>The High Cost of Smoking for employers</h4>
          <p>The direct and indirect economic costs associated with tobacco use are significant. As with other chronic conditions, employers are significantly affected by the indirect costs of the health problems that result from tobacco use.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the direct and indirect costs of smoking are estimated at $138 billion per year.</li>
            <li>Cigarette smokers experience about 6% more physician office visits and spend 27% more days in the hospital than those who never smoked.</li>
            <li>Indirect non-medical costs include lost wages, lost workdays, costs related to using replacement workers, overtime premiums, productivity losses related to unscheduled absences, and productivity losses of workers on the job.</li>
            <li>A national study found that smoking was the one of the greatest causes of lost productivity</li>
            <li>The economic costs of smoking are estimated to be about $3,391 per smoker per year. Each pack of cigarettes sold in the United States costs the nation an estimated $7.18 in medical care costs and lost productivity.</li>
            <li>The direct medical costs associated with smoking totaled approximately $75.5 billion (average 1997-2001), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</li>
            <li>Businesses pay an average of $2,189 in workers&rsquo; compensation costs for smokers, compared with $176 for nonsmokers.</li>
            <li>Even nonsmoking employees can receive workers&rsquo; compensation, unemployment compensation, disability benefits, and other settlements based upon their exposure to secondhand smoke in the workplace.</li>
            <li>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2005) each employee who smokes costs employers $1,897 in lost productivity each year.</li>
            <li>Studies have found that on average, smokers miss 6.16 days of work per year due to sickness (including smoking related acute and chronic conditions), compared to nonsmokers, who miss 3.86 days of work per year.</li>
            <li>Employees who take four 10-minute smoking breaks a day actually work one month less per year than workers who don&rsquo;t take smoking breaks.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>How Employers Benefit from a smoking cessation program</h4>
          <p>
            A number of studies have examined the cost savings from tobacco prevention programs. On average a the annual cost of treating smoking-related illness ranged from $6.00 to $33.00 per smoker.
            Smart Ways to Break Cigarette Addiction
            &ldquo;Eighty percent of America&rsquo;s 44 million smokers want to quit but don&rsquo;t know how,&rdquo; according to Dr. Robert Shipley, who directs the QuitSmart&reg; Stop Smoking Class at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, NC.
            &ldquo;The most effective strategies for breaking free of cigarettes address both the addictive and psychological aspects of smoking,&rdquo; says Shipley, a former smoker. &ldquo;Nicotine is addictive. We don&rsquo;t expect people addicted to other drugs to stop using them on their own, yet for some reason smokers are often expected to quit without help. It&rsquo;s a premise that invites failure.&rdquo;
            Program is conducted in 4 sessions. 3 in-person group sessions plus a 4th personal follow up call from program facilitator.
            General program Schedule:
            Session 1 followed approximately two weeks later with Session 2 and Session 3 is two days after session 2. Personal follow up calls are the following week.
          </p>
          <p>Program includes these components:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Brand switching</li>
            <li>Medication options including: nicotine replacement and other appropriate medications  (medications are not provided in the program. the medication options are reviewed and information provided about how to use them)</li>
            <li>Self-image thinking</li>
            <li>Hypnosis and stress management</li>
            <li>Withdrawal symptom management</li>
            <li>Relapse prevention</li>
            <li>Social support (inside and outside the sessions)</li>
            <li>Weight control advice</li>
            <li>Optional:  2 treatment sessions of ear Acupuncture at session 2 and 3</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            All participants receive the Quit Smart kit: Program guide book, self hypnosis CD, patented cigarette substitute
            Emotional Support
          </p>
          <p>The class also covers how to enlist the support and encouragement of others, minimize weight gain, and maintain one&rsquo;s emotional balance as a nonsmoker.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to add enough pleasures to your life to compensate for giving up cigarettes,&rdquo; Shipley says, &ldquo;pleasures such as flowers for your desk and extra time for yourself. Adding pleasure can prevent the feeling of loss or sadness that some people experience after quitting.&rdquo;</p>
